How to create a new branch on Github  Checkout Between Branches  Commits & Push code to repository

🌳 What is a Branch? (Very Simple)

Imagine:

Your project is a notebook.

The main branch is the original notebook.

A new branch is like making a photocopy to try changes safely.

If something goes wrong in the new branch → your original notebook is still safe.

So we create branches when:

Adding a new feature

Fixing a bug

Testing something

============================================================

🟢 PART 1 — Check Where You Are

Open terminal inside your project folder and type:

git status


This tells you:

Which branch you are on

If there are any changes

To see your current branch:

git branch


The branch with * is your current branch (usually main).

🌿 PART 2 — Create a New Branch
Step 1: Create the branch
git branch new-branch-name


Example:

git branch feature-login


This creates the branch
BUT you are still on the old branch.

Step 2: Switch to the new branch
git checkout new-branch-name


Example:

git checkout feature-login


Now you are working inside that branch.

🔥 Shortcut (Create + Switch in one command)

Instead of 2 commands, you can do:

git checkout -b feature-login


This:

Creates branch

Switches to it

Modern Git alternative:

git switch -c feature-login
