How to create a new branch on Github  Checkout Between Branches  Commits & Push code to repository

🌳 What is a Branch? (Very Simple)

Imagine:

Your project is a notebook.

The main branch is the original notebook.

A new branch is like making a photocopy to try changes safely.

If something goes wrong in the new branch → your original notebook is still safe.

So we create branches when:

Adding a new feature

Fixing a bug

Testing something

============================================================

🟢 PART 1 — Check Where You Are

Open terminal inside your project folder and type:

git status


This tells you:

Which branch you are on

If there are any changes

To see your current branch:

git branch


The branch with * is your current branch (usually main).

🌿 PART 2 — Create a New Branch
Step 1: Create the branch
git branch new-branch-name


Example:

git branch feature-login


This creates the branch
BUT you are still on the old branch.

Step 2: Switch to the new branch
git checkout new-branch-name


Example:

git checkout feature-login


Now you are working inside that branch.

🔥 Shortcut (Create + Switch in one command)

Instead of 2 commands, you can do:

git checkout -b feature-login


This:

Creates branch

Switches to it

Modern Git alternative:

git switch -c feature-login

🏷️ PART 3 — Branch Naming Conventions (Recommended)

Using clear branch names makes teamwork and pull requests much easier.

🔁 Common Branch Types & Naming Patterns

🏠 Main Branches (long-lived)

main — stable production code
develop — integration branch for upcoming work (optional)

🆕 Feature Branches

Pattern:
feature/<short-description>

Examples:
feature/login-page
feature/add-user-authentication
feature/update-dashboard-ui

🐛 Bugfix / Fix Branches

Pattern:
bugfix/<short-description>

Examples:
bugfix/fix-login-error
bugfix/correct-header-layout
bugfix/resolve-api-timeout

Alternative prefix:
fix/<short-description>

🔥 Hotfix Branches (urgent production fixes)

Pattern:
hotfix/<short-description>

Examples:
hotfix/security-patch
hotfix/urgent-data-fix

🏷️ Release Branches

Pattern:
release/<version-number>

Examples:
release/v1.0.0
release/v1.2.0

📘 Other Useful Branch Types

docs/update-readme
refactor/code-cleanup
test/add-unit-tests
chore/update-dependencies

📏 Naming Best Practices

✔ Start with a purpose prefix (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/, etc.)
✔ Use lowercase only
✔ Use hyphens (-) between words
✔ Keep names short but descriptive
✔ Optionally include ticket IDs (example: feature/123-login-page)

🛠️ Quick Mapping

Develop login UI → feature/login-page
Fix a UI bug → bugfix/header-alignment
Prepare a release → release/v1.0.0
Emergency production fix → hotfix/security-patch

===========================================================

💬 PART 4 — How Managers and Developers Discuss Pull Requests (PRs)

In real teams, pull requests are collaborative conversations.
People do not just approve or reject — they discuss, suggest, clarify, and improve the code together.

## 1) Types of comments you’ll see

### 🔹 General conversation comments
Used for high-level feedback in the Conversation tab.

Example:
Manager: “This looks good overall, but please handle invalid input and update README steps.”
Developer: “Done — I added validation and updated README in the latest commit.”

### 🔹 Inline code comments
Used for line-by-line feedback in Files changed.

Example:
Reviewer: “On line 42, can we avoid hard-coding this string and use a constant?”
Developer: “Good suggestion — switched to const LOGIN_TIMEOUT.”

### 🔹 Review summaries
After reviewing, a reviewer submits one of:
- Approve
- Request changes
- Comment

Example:
Reviewer: “Request changes: split the login handler into smaller functions and add invalid-password tests.”
Manager: “Agree. Once tests are added, we can merge.”

## 2) Typical real-world interaction flow

Dev: Created PR for login page feature.
Manager: Thanks! Please align error messages to our style guide.
Dev: Updated in latest commit.
Reviewer: There may be a null pointer risk here.
Dev: Fixed and pushed.
Reviewer: Approved 👍
Manager: Approved and merged.

## 3) Best practices for healthy PR discussions

### 👍 For developers
- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
- Ask specific questions when you want targeted review.
  Example: “Is this regex acceptable for password validation?”

### 🧑‍💼 For managers/reviewers
- Explain why feedback matters (security, maintainability, user impact).
- Keep comments actionable and clear.

### 📌 Use @mentions
If a specific person should respond, tag them.
Example: @alice Could you re-review the API changes?

### 📍 Resolve conversations
Mark threads resolved once fixed, so the PR stays clean and focused.

## 4) Tone matters

Use constructive language:
- “Could we instead do…?”
- “What if we try…?”
- “Please consider…?”

Respectful wording makes reviews faster, easier, and more productive.

✅ PR discussion lifecycle in short:
Developer opens PR → reviewers comment → developer updates code → reviewers re-check → approvals → merge.
