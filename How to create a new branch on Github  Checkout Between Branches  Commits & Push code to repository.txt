How to create a new branch on Github  Checkout Between Branches  Commits & Push code to repository

🌳 What is a Branch? (Very Simple)

Imagine:

Your project is a notebook.

The main branch is the original notebook.

A new branch is like making a photocopy to try changes safely.

If something goes wrong in the new branch → your original notebook is still safe.

So we create branches when:

Adding a new feature

Fixing a bug

Testing something

============================================================

🟢 PART 1 — Check Where You Are

Open terminal inside your project folder and type:

git status

This tells you:

Which branch you are on

If there are any changes

To see your current branch:

git branch

The branch with * is your current branch (usually main).

============================================================

🌿 PART 2 — Create a New Branch

Step 1: Create the branch

git branch new-branch-name

Example:

git branch feature-login

This creates the branch
BUT you are still on the old branch.

Step 2: Switch to the new branch

git checkout new-branch-name

Example:

git checkout feature-login

Now you are working inside that branch.

🔥 Shortcut (Create + Switch in one command)

Instead of 2 commands, you can do:

git checkout -b feature-login

This:

Creates branch

Switches to it

Modern Git alternative:

git switch -c feature-login

============================================================

🔁 PART 3 — Checkout Between Existing Branches

See all local branches:

git branch

Switch to another existing branch:

git checkout branch-name

or modern alternative:

git switch branch-name

Example:

git checkout main
git checkout feature-login

Tip:
If Git says you have uncommitted changes, either commit them or stash them before switching:

git stash
git checkout main
git checkout feature-login
git stash pop

============================================================

🚀 PART 4 — Real-World Developer Workflow (Feature → PR → Merge)

1) Start from the Main (or Develop) Branch

Most projects keep stable code in a branch like main or develop.

git checkout main
git pull origin main

This makes sure your local branch is up to date.

2) Create a Feature Branch

Create a new branch for your feature so you don’t edit main directly.

git checkout -b feature/add-login-page

Use meaningful names like feature/login-page or fix/issue-123.

3) Write Your Code

Do your development work, for example:

- Create login UI
- Add validation
- Implement authentication logic

Stage and commit often with clear commit messages:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: add login form component"
git commit -m "feat: implement login authentication logic"

4) Push the Feature Branch to Remote

git push -u origin feature/add-login-page

This creates (or updates) your branch on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

5) Create a Pull Request (PR)

On GitHub:

- Open the repository
- Click Compare & pull request
- Set source = feature branch, target = main/develop
- Add title, description, and linked issue (if any)

PRs allow review before code is merged.

6) Code Review

Teammates can:

- Comment on specific lines
- Suggest changes
- Approve or request updates

Example feedback:

- "Please add validation for empty input"
- "Consider using a modal for login errors"

7) Address Review Feedback

If changes are requested:

git add .
git commit -m "fix: add input validation per review feedback"
git push origin feature/add-login-page

Your PR updates automatically.

8) Merge the Approved Pull Request

After approvals and passing CI checks, merge the PR.

Common merge options on GitHub:

- Merge commit (preserves all commits)
- Squash and merge (one combined commit)
- Rebase and merge (linear history)

Then delete the feature branch.

9) Clean Up and Sync

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/add-login-page

This syncs local main and removes the local feature branch.

Optional: Resolve Conflicts

If your branch is behind main while you are working:

git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

Resolve conflicts locally, then commit and push.

============================================================

🧠 Overall Flow in Short

1. Create branch for a feature
2. Develop and commit code
3. Push branch to remote
4. Open PR for review
5. Team reviews and comments
6. Address feedback and push updates
7. Merge approved PR into main
8. Delete branch and sync local

This is the core GitHub Flow used by many teams.
