How to create a new branch on Github  Checkout Between Branches  Commits & Push code to repository

🌳 What is a Branch? (Very Simple)

Imagine:

Your project is a notebook.

The main branch is the original notebook.

A new branch is like making a photocopy to try changes safely.

If something goes wrong in the new branch → your original notebook is still safe.

So we create branches when:

Adding a new feature

Fixing a bug

Testing something

============================================================

🟢 PART 1 — Check Where You Are

Open terminal inside your project folder and type:

git status


This tells you:

Which branch you are on

If there are any changes

To see your current branch:

git branch


The branch with * is your current branch (usually main).

🌿 PART 2 — Create a New Branch
Step 1: Create the branch
git branch new-branch-name


Example:

git branch feature-login


This creates the branch
BUT you are still on the old branch.

Step 2: Switch to the new branch
git checkout new-branch-name


Example:

git checkout feature-login


Now you are working inside that branch.

🔥 Shortcut (Create + Switch in one command)

Instead of 2 commands, you can do:

git checkout -b feature-login


This:

Creates branch

Switches to it

Modern Git alternative:

git switch -c feature-login
===========================================================

🏷️ PART 3 — Branch Naming Conventions (Recommended)

Using clear branch names makes teamwork and pull requests much easier.

🔁 Common Branch Types & Naming Patterns

🏠 Main Branches (long-lived)

main — stable production code
develop — integration branch for upcoming work (optional)

🆕 Feature Branches

Pattern:
feature/<short-description>

Examples:
feature/login-page
feature/add-user-authentication
feature/update-dashboard-ui

🐛 Bugfix / Fix Branches

Pattern:
bugfix/<short-description>

Examples:
bugfix/fix-login-error
bugfix/correct-header-layout
bugfix/resolve-api-timeout

Alternative prefix:
fix/<short-description>

🔥 Hotfix Branches (urgent production fixes)

Pattern:
hotfix/<short-description>

Examples:
hotfix/security-patch
hotfix/urgent-data-fix

🏷️ Release Branches

Pattern:
release/<version-number>

Examples:
release/v1.0.0
release/v1.2.0

📘 Other Useful Branch Types

docs/update-readme
refactor/code-cleanup
test/add-unit-tests
chore/update-dependencies

📏 Naming Best Practices

✔ Start with a purpose prefix (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/, etc.)
✔ Use lowercase only
✔ Use hyphens (-) between words
✔ Keep names short but descriptive
✔ Optionally include ticket IDs (example: feature/123-login-page)

🛠️ Quick Mapping

Develop login UI → feature/login-page
Fix a UI bug → bugfix/header-alignment
Prepare a release → release/v1.0.0
Emergency production fix → hotfix/security-patch

===========================================================

🧠 PART 4 — Real-Time Reviews & Comments on GitHub (PRs + Issues)

## 1) Comment on a Pull Request (PR)

### 🟡 Comment in the Conversation tab

- Open the PR on GitHub.
- Scroll down to the discussion area.
- Type a comment and click **Comment**.

Use this for general feedback on the whole PR (for example: “Looks good overall”).

### 🔵 Comment on specific lines of code

1. Open the **Files changed** tab.
2. Hover over the line number.
3. Click the **➕** icon.
4. Write feedback and submit.

This comment is attached to that exact code line in the diff.

💡 Tip: You can suggest code changes directly with GitHub’s suggestion feature, including fenced blocks like:

```suggestion
<input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email address">
```

## 2) Submit a Full Review

After adding line comments:

1. Click **Review changes** (top-right in **Files changed**).
2. Add a summary comment.
3. Pick one:
   - **Comment** (feedback only)
   - **Approve** (accept changes)
   - **Request changes** (changes required before merge)
4. Click **Submit review**.

This creates a formal, trackable review record in the PR.

## 3) Comment on Issues

- Open an issue from the **Issues** tab.
- Write your message at the bottom.
- Click **Comment**.

Issues are used for bugs, feature requests, and planning discussions.

To find issues you are involved in, search:

involves:@me

## 4) Reply to Existing Comments

In both PRs and issues:

- Click **Reply** under a comment.
- Add your response and submit.

This creates threaded conversations and improves collaboration clarity.

## ✅ Professional Best Practices

- Be clear and actionable in feedback.
- Use `@mentions` to notify teammates.
- Use emoji reactions for quick acknowledgement.
- Suggest concrete code updates when possible.
- Avoid merging while critical feedback is unresolved.

## 📌 Example PR Review Flow (Login Page)

1. Open PR → **Files changed**.
2. Add line comment: “Consider more descriptive error messages.”
3. Add an inline suggestion block where needed.
4. Click **Review changes** → **Request changes** with a short summary.

This is the standard professional workflow for structured, traceable GitHub collaboration.
