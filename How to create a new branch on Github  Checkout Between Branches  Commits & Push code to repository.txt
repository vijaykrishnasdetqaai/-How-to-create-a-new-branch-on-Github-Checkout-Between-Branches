How to create a new branch on Github  Checkout Between Branches  Commits & Push code to repository

🌳 What is a Branch? (Very Simple)

Imagine:

Your project is a notebook.

The main branch is the original notebook.

A new branch is like making a photocopy to try changes safely.

If something goes wrong in the new branch → your original notebook is still safe.

So we create branches when:

Adding a new feature

Fixing a bug

Testing something

============================================================

🟢 PART 1 — Check Where You Are

Open terminal inside your project folder and type:

git status


This tells you:

Which branch you are on

If there are any changes

To see your current branch:

git branch


The branch with * is your current branch (usually main).

🌿 PART 2 — Create a New Branch
Step 1: Create the branch
git branch new-branch-name


Example:

git branch feature-login


This creates the branch
BUT you are still on the old branch.

Step 2: Switch to the new branch
git checkout new-branch-name


Example:

git checkout feature-login


Now you are working inside that branch.

🔥 Shortcut (Create + Switch in one command)

Instead of 2 commands, you can do:

git checkout -b feature-login


This:

Creates branch

Switches to it

Modern Git alternative:

git switch -c feature-login
===========================================================

🏷️ PART 3 — Branch Naming Conventions (Recommended)

Using clear branch names makes teamwork and pull requests much easier.

🔁 Common Branch Types & Naming Patterns

🏠 Main Branches (long-lived)

main — stable production code
develop — integration branch for upcoming work (optional)

🆕 Feature Branches

Pattern:
feature/<short-description>

Examples:
feature/login-page
feature/add-user-authentication
feature/update-dashboard-ui

🐛 Bugfix / Fix Branches

Pattern:
bugfix/<short-description>

Examples:
bugfix/fix-login-error
bugfix/correct-header-layout
bugfix/resolve-api-timeout

Alternative prefix:
fix/<short-description>

🔥 Hotfix Branches (urgent production fixes)

Pattern:
hotfix/<short-description>

Examples:
hotfix/security-patch
hotfix/urgent-data-fix

🏷️ Release Branches

Pattern:
release/<version-number>

Examples:
release/v1.0.0
release/v1.2.0

📘 Other Useful Branch Types

docs/update-readme
refactor/code-cleanup
test/add-unit-tests
chore/update-dependencies

📏 Naming Best Practices

✔ Start with a purpose prefix (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/, etc.)
✔ Use lowercase only
✔ Use hyphens (-) between words
✔ Keep names short but descriptive
✔ Optionally include ticket IDs (example: feature/123-login-page)

🛠️ Quick Mapping

Develop login UI → feature/login-page
Fix a UI bug → bugfix/header-alignment
Prepare a release → release/v1.0.0
Emergency production fix → hotfix/security-patch
