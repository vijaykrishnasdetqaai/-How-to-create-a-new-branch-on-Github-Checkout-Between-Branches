How to create a new branch on Github  Checkout Between Branches  Commits & Push code to repository

🌳 What is a Branch? (Very Simple)

Imagine:

Your project is a notebook.

The main branch is the original notebook.

A new branch is like making a photocopy to try changes safely.

If something goes wrong in the new branch → your original notebook is still safe.

So we create branches when:

Adding a new feature

Fixing a bug

Testing something
